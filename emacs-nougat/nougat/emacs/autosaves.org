* autosaves
Auto-save will periodically save your file to backup file while you
edit. This is great if something goes catastrophically wrong to Emacs!

** store autosaves in a single place
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defvar emacs-autosave-directory
    (concat user-emacs-directory "autosaves/")
    "This variable dictates where to put auto saves. It is set to a
    directory called autosaves located wherever your .emacs.d/ is
    located.")

  (unless (file-exists-p emacs-autosave-directory)
      (make-directory emacs-autosave-directory))

  (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms `((".*"
  ,emacs-autosave-directory t)))
#+end_src

** set save interval
Here, save every 20 secs or 20 keystrokes.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (setq auto-save-timeout 20
        auto-save-interval 20)
#+end_src

** autosave every buffer that visits a file
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (setq auto-save-default t)
#+end_src

** disable lockfiles
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(setq create-lockfiles nil)
#+end_src
