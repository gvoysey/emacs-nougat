** undo-tree
[[http://www.dr-qubit.org/undo-tree.html][undo-tree]] is a way to view emacs undo feature as a tree.

#+begin_quote
undo-tree-mode provided by this package replaces Emacs' undo system with a system
that treats undo history as what it is: a branching tree of changes. This simple idea
allows the more intuitive behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined
with the power of never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo history
can in some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more changes to accumulate
before Emacs starts discarding history.

It gets better. You don't have to imagine the undo tree, because undo-tree-mode
includes an undo-tree visualizer which draws it for you, and lets you browse around
the undo history.
