* Fundamentals
The fundamental drivers of this configuration layout system are:
- straight.el
- use-package
- org-mode.
These components *must* be present; everything else is user-specific.
* package management with straight.el and use-package
[[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight.el]] is a next-generation, purely functional package manager for the Emacs
hacker.
#+INCLUDE: "../nougat/package-management/straight.org::bootstrap straight" :minlevel 2
#+INCLUDE: "../nougat/package-management/straight.org::configure use-package integration" :minlevel 2
** Disable other config files
Since all the configuration should live in this version-controlled file, discard any
customizations made inside Emacs.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (setq custom-file (make-temp-file ""))
#+end_src

* org-mode
